{: .no_toc }

---

{: .definition }
The software can be found and unequivocally identified.

## F1 - Identity uniqueness 

The software has a proper, unique and persistent identifier. 

### F1.1 - Uniqueness of name

#### What is being measured?
Whether the software has a unique name to identify it.

#### Why should we measure it?
The name is commonly used as the main identifier of a software. Each tool should have a unique name to avoid ambiguities. Different versions of the same software should share a name, but if substantial modifications in the algorithm are done, the identifier should change for the new piece of software.

#### How do we measure it?
A name is valid.

#### Types it applies to 
all

### F1.2 - Identifiability of version
#### What is being measured?
Whether there is a scheme to uniquely and properly identify the software version.

#### Why should we measure it?
A version scheme is necessary to refer to a specific release of a software and keep track of the incrementally different versions of the software.

#### How do we measure it?
A version of the form X.X is considered valid.

#### Types it applies to 
all


## F2 - Existence of Metadata 

The software is described with rich metadata, including scientific applicability.

### F2.1 Structured Metadata

#### What is being measured?
Metadata is adjusted to specific metadata formats

#### Why should we measure it?
Specific formats are more machine readable, which increases its findability by search engines

#### How do we measure it?
At least a source of structured metadata is considered valid.

#### Types it applies to 
all

### F2.2 Standardized Metadata

#### What is being measured?
Metadata is described using accepted ontologies

#### Why should we measure it?
The same piece of information about a software can be stated in many equivalent forms. Each tool being described with different terminology, with non specified meanings, makes metadata very hard to interpret. Automatic processing is also harder. When searching for a software with certain features, the lack of a consusuate terminology makes the process of searching slow and difficult.

#### How do we measure it?
EDAM, bioschema

#### Types it applies to 
all

## F3 - Searchability 

The software can be found.

### F3.1 - Searchability in registries

#### What is being measured?
Whether software is included in the main software registries.

#### Why should we measure it?
Software registries are the main resource scientists use when searching for software.

#### How do we measure it?
At least one software registry among the instance sources is considered valid.

#### Types it applies to 
all

### F3.2 - Searchability in software repositories

#### What is being measured?
Whether software can be found in any of the major software repositories e.g. GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge,

#### Why should we measure it?
Software repositories can be an additional resource used by scientists when looking for software

#### How do we measure it?
An associated software repository is considered valid.

#### Types it applies to 
all

### F3.3 - Searchability in literature

#### What is being measured?
Whether software can be found in specialized literature services e.g. EuropePMC, PubMed, Journals Site, biorxiv

#### Why should we measure it?
Specialized literature is a good reference to find software, especially to discover new software

#### How do we measure it?
At least one associated publication is considered valid.

#### Types it applies to 
all
